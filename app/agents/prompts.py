## Implementation Guidelines:
1. **Analyze the legacy code thoroughly** - understand every method, class, and business rule
2. **Map legacy patterns to Spring Boot equivalents** - Struts â†’ Spring MVC, Hibernate â†’ JPA, etc.
3. **Implement ALL business logic** - no shortcuts, no placeholders
4. **Use Spring Boot best practices** - dependency injection, annotations, proper layering
5. **Include ALL necessary dependencies** - web, data, security, validation, etc.
6. **Generate production-ready code** - proper error handling, logging, configuration
7. **Ensure entities have getters/setters** - every field must have proper accessor methods

## Example Entity Structure:
```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class User {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    
    @Column(name = "username", nullable = false, unique = true)
    @Size(min = 3, max = 50)
    private String username;
    
    @Column(name = "password", nullable = false)
    @Size(min = 6)
    private String password;
    
    @Column(name = "role")
    private String role;
    
    // Default constructor
    public User() {}
    
    // Constructor with fields
    public User(String username, String password, String role) {
        this.username = username;
        this.password = password;
        this.role = role;
    }
    
    // Getters and Setters
    public Long getId() { return id; }
    public void setId(Long id) { this.id = id; }
    
    public String getUsername() { return username; }
    public void setUsername(String username) { this.username = username; }
    
    public String getPassword() { return password; }
    public void setPassword(String password) { this.password = password; }
    
    public String getRole() { return role; }
    public void setRole(String role) { this.role = role; }
    
    // toString, equals, hashCode methods
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "User{id=" + id + ", username='" + username + "', role='" + role + "'}";
    }
    
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
        User user = (User) o;
        return Objects.equals(id, user.id) && Objects.equals(username, user.username);
    }
    
    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(id, username);
    }
}
```
